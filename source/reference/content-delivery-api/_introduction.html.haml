  The Content Delivery API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
  API for delivering content from Contentful to apps, websites and other media.
  Content is delivered as JSON data; images, videos and other media is delivered as files.

  The API is a globally distributed CDN for content: All content, both JSON and binary, is served
  from the server closest to where a user is requesting content from. This minimizes latency,
  which especially mobile apps can greatly benefit from. Also, hosting content in multiple datacenters around
  the world greatly improves the availability of content.

  The Content Delivery API is served at `cdn.contentful.com`.

  In Contentful content is represented as [Entries](#entries) and [Assets](#assets) divided into [Spaces](#spaces).
  Apps and websites depend on the structure of Entries, so every Entry must comply to a specific
  [Content Type](#content-types). Assets represent binary files like for example images.

  All content can be [securely accessed via HTTPS](#security) and will only be delivered if a
  client [authenticates with an access token](#authentication).

    We've also made sure that web apps can access your content directly by means of liberal [cross-origin resource sharing](#cors).

  If you want to manage content through scripts or custom applications use the [Content Management API](/developers/documentation/content-management-api/).
  The Content Delivery API is meant to be used only for delivering content, not managing it.

  We've made this documentation very interactive. To [get started](#getting-started) just read further and we'll take you through a quick tour of the Content Delivery API.
