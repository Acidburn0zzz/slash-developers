As an API-first service, we understand that providing sensible and up-to-date docs is vitally important. Here you'll find everything necessary for setting up and going deeper: introductory explanations, API reference, more specific tutorials, SDKs and libraries for major platforms, as well as other helpful tools and code samples.

## Concepts

These articles introduce the basics of Contentful, explain our data model, and provide some best practices. Perhaps this is the best place to start if you haven't built anything with Contentful before.

- [API basics](/developers/documentation/concepts/apis/)
- [Data model](/developers/documentation/concepts/data-model/)
- [Links](/developers/documentation/concepts/links/)
- [Locales](/developers/documentation/concepts/locales/)
- [Synchronization](/developers/documentation/concepts/sync/)

## API Reference

This is the go-to place if you have some specific question in mind. *How do I authorize my app? How do I fetch an entry? How do I request an image of a specific size?* The questions as such are answered in the sections listed below.

There are four APIs available, and each serves one specific purpose:

- <a href="http://docs.contentfulcda.apiary.io" target="_blank">Content delivery API</a> for getting the content
- <a href="http://docs.contentfulcma.apiary.io" target="_blank">Content management API</a> for saving the content
- <a href="http://docs.contentpreviewapi.apiary.io" target="_blank">Content preview API</a> for previewing the content before publishing it to production
- <a href="http://docs.contentfulimagesapi.apiary.io" target="_blank">Images API</a> for requesting images of specific sizes and formats

Also, there are several documents which are relevant for all the APIs:

- [Errors](/developers/documentation/references/errors/)
- [HTTP response details](/developers/documentation/references/http-details/)
- [Authentication](/developers/documentation/references/authentication/)

## Tutorials

- [iOS development tutorials](/developers/documentation/tutorials/ios/)
- [Using the delivery API on iOS](/developers/documentation/tutorials/ios/using-delivery-api-on-ios/)
- [Using the management API on iOS](/developers/documentation/tutorials/ios/using-management-api-on-ios/)
- [Offline persistence in the iOS SDK](/developers/documentation/tutorials/ios/offline-persistence-in-ios-sdk)
- [Using the Contentful Xcode plugin](/developers/documentation/tutorials/ios/using-contentful-xcode-plugin)

## Libraries

We provide libraries for major programming languages and platforms so you don't have to write the code for interacting with API from scratch.

- [Java/Android](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#java-also-for-use-on-android)
- [JavaScript](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#javascript)
- [Objective-C / Swift](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#objective-c--swift-for-use-on-ios-and-os-x)
- [Python](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#python)
- [Ruby](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#ruby)
- [Third-party libraries: PHP, C#, .NET and more](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/#unofficial)
- [See all libraries](/developers/documentation/code/libraries/)

## Tools

There are more tools which help speed up development. Find content import/export tools, iOS and Android development plugins and more.
