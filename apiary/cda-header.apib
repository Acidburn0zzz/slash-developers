# Contentful Delivery API

The Contentful Delivery API is a _fast_ read-only API for retrieving your content from Contentful. Content is delivered as JSON data; images, videos and other media is delivered as files.

It is powered by our global CDN so you get the benefits of our content-aware caching: All content, both JSON and binary, is served from the server closest to where a user is requesting content from. This minimizes latency, which especially mobile apps can greatly benefit from. Also, hosting content in multiple datacenters around the world greatly improves the availability of content.
