## Authentication

To get content from the Content Delivery API, clients need to provide an access token. Access tokens are created per Space and are used by clients to access the Space's content.

You can create Access tokens for your own Spaces in the "API" tab of the web interface.

The Content Delivery API implements the standardized OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Specification. This authorization scheme is very simple and already supported by many HTTP clients.

The API supports two mechanisms for supplying the access token.

As an Authorization HTTP request-header field and as an URI query parameter named `access_token`.
