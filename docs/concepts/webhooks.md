Webhooks in Contentful can notify you or someone else when content (Assets, Entries or Content Types) has changed by calling a preconfigured HTTP endpoint. This can be used for notifications, static site generators or other forms of post-processing that is sourced from Contentful.

Whenever an event like that occurs, you can set up a webhook that would call the specified URI in order to somehow react. For instance, you can send a push notification or a message to a Slack channel every time an entry has been edited to keep up with the changes.

See our documentation for all the details (/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/webhooks/)
