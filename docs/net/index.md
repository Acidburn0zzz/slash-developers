**We don't yet have an official .NET SDK**, but if you would like to start developing now, you can check out the HTTP Endpoints or start with the third party SDK listed below.

Please notice that this library is **not officially supported** by Contentful and may be incomplete, but we've at least tried it out.
If you want to check all of our non supported SDKs and Tools, check out our repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/contentful-labs/awesome-contentful).
